# Tink Connect Example

This is an example web app that demonstrates how you can integrate the Tink API to fetch users' account and transaction data.

This app was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Other than that, it has been made as simple as possible.

## Installation

The application requires a Tink API developer account.

### Prerequisites

1) Create your developer account at [Tink Console](https://console.tink.com)
2) Follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.tink.com/resources/getting-started/set-up-your-account) to retrieve your `client_id` and `client_secret`
3) Register the redirect URI for the example app (`http://localhost:3000/callback`) in the [list of allowed redirect URIs](https://console.tink.com/apps)

### Structure

* **Node server/backend**: can be found in `server.js`
* **React client/frontend**: can be found in the `client` folder.

## Running the app locally

1) Install the dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

2) Set your client identifier and client secret into the following environment variables

```
$ export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
$ export REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

3) Run both the backend (`server.js`) and the frontend (`client` folder) concurrently:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You should be redirected to the client app on `http://localhost:3000/`. The client runs on port `3000` and the server runs on `8080`.
